# Introduction to bioinformatics for microbiologists (Uni Helsinki)
The aim of the course is to provide participants with basic knowledge of bioinformatic tools available to exploit microbial research. In particular, the course will introduce students to analytical pipeline for Next-Generation sequencing (NGS) data. The students will learn about the characteristics and usage of basic web-based and some stand-alone bioinformatic tools, and their applications in microbial research. The students will be able to perform simple bioinformatic tasks using these tools, and will be able to search for more information online.
