### Introduction of BLAST
Detailed description of the statistics of Sequence Similarity Scores in BLAST is available [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/tutorial/Altschul-1.html). A description of the [BLAST result page](ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/factsheets/HowTo_NewBLAST.pdf). 
### Student presentations
Each group will have 15 minutes for presenting their results and a summary of the resources they used. After each presentation 15 minutes of discussion will follow, covering theoretical and practical aspects of genome comparison performed by the group.
### Visualization of genomic comparisons
There are several methodologies which can be used for visualizing genome comparisons. We will focused on the following ones:
* [Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT)](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/artemis-comparison-tool-act)
* [Mauve](http://darlinglab.org/mauve/mauve.html)
* [BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG)](http://brig.sourceforge.net/)
* [Phandango](https://github.com/jameshadfield/phandango)
* [Circos Table Viewer](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/tableviewer/)
